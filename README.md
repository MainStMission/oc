## Who Are We?

![Main Street Mission](/app/assets/images/msm_logo.png)
Main Street Mission is food pantry in China Grove, North Carolina, USA. The mission provides food and other donated items to
members of the community in need. This project aims to create an inventory and volunteer tracking system for use in food pantries and
food banks. There are not any good options for software for the small non-profits that run these pantries. This project will create a
software system tailored to the needs of Main Street Mission and other food pantries.

You can read a bit more about the mission and this project in Tom's
[History of Main St. Mission's Food Pantry Manager](https://github.com/MainStMission/food-pantry-manager/blob/master/HISTORY.md).

## Open Cupboard Project

The Original Food Pantry application was developed in Ruby and Rails and has been in daily use at Main Street Mission for about one and one half years. We have been very happy with it and want to make it available on an open source basis to other food pantries. The intent of the Open Cupboard Project is create a generic open source version of Food Pantry Manager fthat can be customized and enhanced for use by other Food Pantries. We also want to accomodate future growth by Main Street Mission as we expand our services. Please feel free to contact us if you would like assistance in either deploying the project or in having it custom tailored to your needs.

## Why Should You Help?

Mian Street Mission provides food for about 250 families each month. About 200 children are given school supplies each August. The mission also
provides meals for families on holidays. This is only one food pantry in the US. In [2011 6.1 million households (5.1%)](http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-facts/hunger-and-poverty-statistics.aspx)
accessed emergency food at a pantry in the US. Contributing to this project gives you an opportunity to help this organization and the people
it serves as well as other organizations that want to use the platform. Are you trying to learn Ruby on Rails? Great, we would love to help you learn and it gives you an excellent example to add to
your resume/cv while contributing to a project that helps people. Do you know of a Food Pantry that needs assistance? Great, we can help you get started with Open Cupboard in your organization.
